## How to Play

1. Name your SoulGotchi when you first start
2. Grow your pet's health, spirituality, energy, and happiness by:
   - Performing dhikr (remembrance of Allah)
   - Praying the five daily prayers
   - Allowing your pet to rest
   - Learning Islamic knowledge
3. Your pet's mood will change based on its stats
4. Stats will gradually decrease every 10 seconds if you don't interact
5. If health or spirituality drops to zero, your pet will pass away
6. When all stats reach 100%, your pet achieves enlightenment!

## Dhikr Mechanic

SoulGotchi features a special dhikr system that encourages repeated recitation:

- Each type of dhikr provides different benefits:
  - **Subhanallah** (Glory be to Allah): Primarily increases spirituality
  - **Alhamdulillah** (Praise be to Allah): Primarily increases happiness
  - **Allahu Akbar** (Allah is the Greatest): Primarily increases energy
  - **Astaghfirullah** (I seek forgiveness from Allah): Primarily restores health

- The more you recite each dhikr, the greater the benefits:
  - Every 10 recitations adds a bonus to the benefits
  - You can see your recitation count for each dhikr
  - This encourages consistent practice of dhikr

## Decay Timer

To simulate the need for consistent spiritual practice:

- A countdown timer shows when the next decay will occur (every 10 seconds)
- Each decay reduces all stats by a small amount
- Any interaction with your pet resets the decay timer
- This mechanic encourages regular engagement with Islamic practices

## Haptic Feedback

On supported mobile devices, SoulGotchi provides subtle haptic feedback:

- Gentle vibrations when tapping on buttons and tabs
- Medium vibration when interacting directly with your pet
- Creates a more immersive and engaging experience
- Works on most modern smartphones that support the Vibration API

## Islamic Elements

- **Dhikr**: Recite phrases like "Subhanallah" (Glory be to Allah) and "Alhamdulillah" (Praise be to Allah)
- **Prayer**: Perform the five daily prayers plus Tahajjud (night prayer)
- **Learning**: Study the Quran, Hadith, Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and Islamic history
